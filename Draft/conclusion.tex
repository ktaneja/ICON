\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Although highly desirable, most API's do not have formal specifications.
In contrast documentation of methods contain detailed specifications of the usage in natural language text.
However, formal analysis tools are not designed to work on specifications in natural languages.
Manually writing formal specifications based on natural language text in API documents is prohibitively time consuming and error prone.
To address this issue, we proposed a novel approach \tool\ to infer temporal constraints from natural language text of API documents.
We applied \tool\ to infer temporal constraints from 
commonly used package \CodeIn{java.io} from JDK API and Amazon S3 REST API.
Our evaluation results show that \tool\ achieves an average of 65\% precision and 72\% recall
in inferring 63 temporal constraints from more than 3900 sentences of API documents.
