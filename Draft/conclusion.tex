%API documents provide specification information about how to use a particular method within a class by means of method descriptions. However, specifications described in natural Language in API documents are not amenable to formal verification by existing verification tools. 

%Specifications described in natural language in API documents are not amenable to formal verification by existing verification tools. In this paper, we have presented a novel approach for inferring formal specifications from API documents targeted towards code contract generation. Our evaluation results show that our approach has an average of 92\% precision and 93\% recall in identifying sentences describing code contracts from over 2500 sentences. Furthermore, our results also show that our approach has an average of 83.4\% accuracy in inferring specifications from sentences describing code contracts out of over 1600 sentences.
