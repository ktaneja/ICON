Temporal specifications of an Application Programming
Interface (API) describe allowed sequence of invocations
of methods within an API. Despite being desirable for 
software testing and verification (through formal analysis tools),
most API's do not have formal temporal specifications.
In contrast, API documents contain valuable information about the usage in natural language.
Although existing techniques infer from API documents method specifications (such as method precondition and postconditions) or resource specifications (such as constraints on creating/releasing resources), such techniques fail to explicitly infer temporal constraints.
Manually writing formal specifications based on natural language text in API documents
can be prohibitively time consuming and error prone.
To address this issue, we propose a natural language processing based automated approach \tool,
to infer formal temporal specifications from natural language text of API documents.
\tool\ uses 
To evaluate our proposed approach, we applied \tool\ to infer temporal constraints from 
commonly used package \CodeIn{java.io} from JDK API and \amazonAPI.
Our evaluation results show that \tool\ achieves an average of 66\% precision and 70\% recall
in inferring 69 temporal constraints from more than 3900 sentences of API documents.
