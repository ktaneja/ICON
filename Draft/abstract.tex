Temporal constraints of an Application Programming
Interface (API) are the allowed sequences of invocations
of methods from the API.
These constraints govern the secure and robust
operation of client software using the API.
Typically, these constraints are described in natural language text
of API documents and thus cannot be used by existing verification tools,
which typically accept only formal constraints.
Because manually writing temporal constraints based on
API documents can be prohibitively time consuming and error prone,
we propose \tool: a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based approach
to automatically infer temporal constraints.
In particular, our approach includes a novel technique to reduce the number of lexical tokens
as a way to make API documents amenable to existing NLP techniques
(which are typically designed to work on well-written news articles).
Our approach also includes a novel technique of identifying method references in
the natural language text by building domain dictionaries systematically
from API documents and generic English dictionaries.
To evaluate our approach, we apply \tool\ to infer temporal constraints from 
commonly used package \CodeIn{java.io} in the JDK API and from the \amazonAPI.
Our results show that \tool\ effectively identifies constraint sentences (from over 3900 API sentences) with the average precision, recall, and F-score of 65.0\%, 72.2\%, and 68.4\%, respectively.
Furthermore, \tool\ also achieves an accuracy of 70\% in inferring 63 temporal constraints from these sentences.

% There are existing techniques that infer from API documents resource specifications 
% (such as constraints based on phases: creating, manipulating, and releasing resources).
% However, such techniques are limited to finding temporal specification of resources.
% Furthermore, such techniques do not make a distinction between explicit ordering of methods
% within each phases.
