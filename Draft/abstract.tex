Recently many popular websites such as Twitter and Flickr expose their data through web service APIs, enabling third-party 
organizations to develop client applications that provide functionalities beyond what the original websites offer. These client applications should follow certain constraints in order to correctly interact with the web services.
Violations of such constraints can cause fatal errors 
or incorrect results in the client applications. However, these constraints are often not formally specified and thus not available for 
automatic verification of client applications. To address this issue, 
we propose a novel approach, called \tool,
%to automatically 
%infer dependency constraints on parameters for web services, via a 
%hybrid analysis of heterogeneous web service artifacts, including 
%the service documentation, the service SDKs, and the web services themselves. To evaluate our approach, we applied INDICATOR to infer dependency constraints for four popular web services. 
%The results showed that INDICATOR effectively infers constraints 
%with an average precision of 94.4\% and recall of 95.5\%.
