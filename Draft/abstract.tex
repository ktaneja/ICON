Temporal constraints of an Application Programming Interface (API)
are the allowed sequences of method invocations in the API.
These constraints govern the secure and robust operation of client software using the API.
However, in practice, most API do not have formal temporal constraints.
In contrast, these constraints are typically described
informally in natural language API documents, and therefore are not amenable
to existing program analysis tools that require formal constraints.
\textit{The goal of this work is to assist developers construct API clients that comply with 
temporal constraints of the API through the inference and formalization of these constraints found in natural language text in API documents.}
Since, API documents are often verbose, manually writing formal temporal constraints can be prohibitively time consuming and error prone.
To address this issue,
we propose \tool, a Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) based
approach for identifying and inferring formal temporal constraints.
To evaluate our approach, we apply \tool\ to infer and formalize temporal
constraints from \amazonAPI, \paypalAPI\ and \CodeIn{java.io} package in the
JDK API.
Our results indicate that \tool\ is effective in identifying constraint sentences (from over
4000 human-annotated API sentences) with the average precision, recall, and F-score
of 77.0\%, 60.0\%, and 65.0\%, respectively.
Furthermore, \tool\ also achieves an accuracy of 70\% in inferring 63 formal temporal constraints from these sentences.
