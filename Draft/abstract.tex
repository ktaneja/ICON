Temporal specifications of an Application Programming
Interface (API) describe allowed sequences of invocations
of methods within an API. Despite being desirable for 
software testing and verification (through formal analysis tools),
most API's do not have formal temporal specifications.
In contrast, API documents contain valuable information about the usage in natural language.
However, formal analysis tools are not designed to work on specifications in natural languages.
Manually writing formal specifications based on natural language text in API documents
can be prohibitively time consuming and error prone.
To address this issue, we propose a natural language processing based automated approach \tool ,
to infer formal temporal specifications from natural language text of API documents.
To evaluate our proposed approach, we applied \tool\ to infer temporal constraints from 
commonly used package \CodeIn{java.io} from JDK API and Amazon S3 REST API.
Our evaluation results show that \tool\ achieves an average of 70\% precision and 80\% recall
in inferring 63 temporal constraints from more than 2400 sentences of API documents.
